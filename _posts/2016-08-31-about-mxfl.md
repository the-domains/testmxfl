# About MXFL

## What Madden**X**treme Football is all about

Madden**X**treme Football League is governed by, commissioner, Marvis Hood and commissioner, Rod Hood. The league has a committee that Marvis and Rod put together to handle issues such as, trades, discipline, and other small issues that may arise. Marvis and Rod have been around Madden football since Madden football has been around. Both brothers work hand and hand to make their league friendly and enjoyable to be a part of.

However, Madden**X**treme Football League may not be one of the longest active online leagues but what we have here, is a strong Madden community. Let me explain more. While many leagues around the internet started to fade after about 3 season into Madden 16, Madden**X**treme League was still going very strong. Madden**X**treme League was heading into season 6 with still almost a full league. We decided to take season 6 off due to people's summer vacations and working on a new web site. However, there were still many that wanted to continue. The only reason why Madden Xtreme League is so strong is because we have, integrity, motivation, and dedication to keep this league one of the best Madden league to be a part of.
