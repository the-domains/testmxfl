Gentlemen, we know that everyone is eager for the season to
get started, but before we do we need to go over league expectations.While a good portion of our veteran owners
who have come back, over half of the league are new members and some
participating in their 1st Madden league.We want to make sure that everyone understands what it means to be in
the **M**

**X**

**FL.**We want the **M**

X

**FL** to be an NFL style experience
with realistic stats, realistic strategy and respect for your fellow
owners.I came across a saying that is
going to be the mantra of the **M**

X

**FL** because it sums it all up so well, "

If it does not happen on Sunday it
doesn't happen here"

****

**Communication**

**__Game Scheduling__**

One of the pillars of any league is proper game scheduling
to keep things running smoothly. As you may know we have members from all over
the world. The **M**

**X**

**____****FL**
is truly an international league with members from Japan to Ireland and all
points in between from California to New York.It is essential that all ownerspost their available times for each72 hr game week period in the game scheduling forum at the close of the
current week or when a new game week opens.Post as soon as possible so if there is some difficulty we dont'have to
hold up the league schedule,and it wouldn't hurt to add the international times
to your phone so you can see the exact time zone of the owner you are playing
that week. 

**__Contact Information__**

We will have all of the owner contact info in the OWNER
CONTACT forum thread.All of the owners
are broken down by league division, for example if you play the Cowboys you
would find his info under NFC EAST if the Raiders under AFC WEST etc. The
information that is required is as follows:

1.Twitch ID. For mandatory broadcasting of games and also so
the league will be able to watch the broadcast ofgames being played
(\[u\]\[color=\#BF0000\]Mandatory\[/color\]\[/u\])

2.Forum ID __

_Mandatory_

3.PSN ID __

_Mandatory_

4.Slack ID __

_Mandatory_

5.Twitter __

_Optional _

Quite a
few owners I know personally, but most I have met through Twitter. If you have
a Twitter account it helps us identify owners quickly.Owners are \[u\]not required\[/u\] to have a
Twitter account, as it is optional.

6.Cell\# __

_Optional_

We know some people do not feel comfortable
posting their cell number. I would like everyone to at least direct message the
commissioners your cell number as it helps us expedite contacting owners.

7.Email __

_Mandatory_

8.Timezone __

_Mandatory_

**_Gameplay Conduct_**

_1\. Sportsmanship_

Win or lose be a good sport.If you have an issue with your opponent.pause the game and respectfully
relay your concerns and continue the game.Quitting games will not be tolerated.

We value the chess match aspect of football.Quick snapping is not allowed.After the offensive has picked their play the
offense mustallow the def 5-6 seconds
to make defensive adjustments.It is
imperative for the offense to call a play in a timely manner to allow the
defensive adjustments.

_2.Respect_

Another pillar to a successful league is treating each other
with common courtesy respect .Running up the score on an opponent will not be
tolerated and shows the lack of respect we expect from league owners.Owners are encouraged once the game is in
hand to run the ball and set offensive tempo to chew the clock.Running up the score creates bad
blood,between owners who then want to quit the league which requires the league
to start looking for replacements.

_3.Game Play_

Owners are expected to mix up the play calling both offensively
and defensively, the use of money plays and AI exploits is highly
discouraged.If the use of Madden
exploits is found owners will be removed at the league's discretion

We expect all offensive/defensive personnel to be playing in
their allotted positions; i.e,, wide receivers cannot be at the tight end
position, half backs as full backs etc.Nothing that will create an unnatural match up against the AI.

Defensively; We expect personnel to properly match up with
the offensive personnel.Some people
like to run a dime defense against all formations because of the speedy
personnel. In real life that would not happen because teams would be vulnerable
to the run but in the video game it creates an unnatural; advantage against the
A.I. Our goal is completely realistic gameplay.

**_Positional shifts_**

Users can manually control any player on the field except
DE. We feel this will stop users from moving the player out of madden
positional shifts and creating unrealistic pass rush pressure. QB's. Players
cannot be moved pre snap except for madden shifts and positional alignment only.

Understand that you can move players around within their
positional responsibility

****

**D.6 PLAYER MOVEMENT**

Manual player movement of ONE defender pre-snap is allowed.
The AI is able to account for our manual player movement. Therefore, you may
manually move a defensive back as long as he remains within his
"positional boundaries." You must remain in control of that defensive
player until the ball is snapped on offense. All manually controlled defensive
players must remain within their "positional boundaries" until the
ball is snapped.

Manually controlled players should also mix up their
strategies during the game. A defensive tackle will NOT swim all game as the
offensive lineman would make necessary adjustments to counter that. 

Using a DE is stictly prohibited.

Unfortunately, the
AI does not think that well so mix up your attack.

NFL teams also shift players around in order to get a better
blitz angle. However, there are a lot of "glitch blitzes" that
prevent us from allowing teams to move players around on defense other than
Madden shifts or manually controlled defensive backs. At no point should shifts
be made to take advantage of the D-line spacing or to allow a DB to encroach on
the line in order to reach the quarterback unabated.

****

**D.7 POSITIONAL BOUNDARIES**

"Positional boundaries" are defined as follows:

• D-line - No movement other than defensive line shifts
(pinch, spread, left, right). ALL DEFENSIVE LINEMAN MUST BE VISIBLE AND ON THE
LINE AT THE SNAP OF THE BALL. Spreading the D-line and audibling or manually
controlling the DE's to crash out around the OT's is not allowed. Manually
audibling and/or manually controlling a DE/DT to drop into zone coverage is
also prohibited unless the play called from the huddle is a zone blitz calling
for the DE/DT to drop into coverage.

• LB - One shuffle laterally, either direction, and/or a
Linebacker shift (pinch, spread, left, right). NO MOVEMENT TOWARDS OR AWAY FROM
THE LOS.

• CB -No individual movement allowed. Press and cushion
coverage allowed.

• FS/SS - Lateral, forward, and backward movement allowed;
ONE STEP ONLY FORWARD/BACKWARD. You may NOT move up to the linebackers' depth.

4.Game situations

As for when you can 4th down situations, hurry up offense

****

**O.13 4TH DOWN RULE**

We encourage straight play in this league, however, we do
not want to limit players to the point where they cannot play aggressively.
With that in mind, teams my go for it on fourth down:

• When on your opponents 40-yard line or closer with 2 yards
or less to attain the first down. 

• If the deficit is two touchdowns (14 points) or more in
the second half, teams may attempt fourth down 50 yd line with 4 min or more
left in game, anywhere with 3min or less regardless of field position or
distance to attain the first down.
