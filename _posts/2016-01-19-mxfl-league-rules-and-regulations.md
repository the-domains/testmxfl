**SCHEDULING**

It is recommended that you contact your next opponent for
next week before advance. 

Example: (I can play at 6:30pm Est or from 5-8:30pm Est) 

"Do NOT use just "Morning or Afternoon" 

You must contact your opponent within 24 hours of the last
advance. If contact has not been made theunresponsive coach will be placed on auto for that week. 

If your opponent does not contact you 24 hours after advance
(or 24 hours after you first contacted them), Contact a Commissioner. 

If you fail to make your scheduled time by more than 1 hour
without contacting your opponent, you will be placed on auto.

If your window to play games is less than 2 hours during an
entire advance time, your opponent has the option to play CPU. 

If nobody contacts a Commissioner within 2 hours of normal
scheduled advance, your opponent will not be set on auto. 

DON'T START GAMES YOU DO NOT HAVE TIME TO FINISH!​ 

There will be no extensions granted on an advance, PERIOD!

**AUTOPILOT**

If your opponent is unresponsive or can't play please
contact a Commissioner/Co Commissioner with proof around 8pm EST the day after
each advance. 

​You will NOT be allowed to go on auto unless you have a
legit reason. You may not sit out because your season may be over. 

MISSING 2 STRAIGHT GAMES WILL RESULT IN AUTOMATIC REMOVAL!

**DISCONNECTS**

Online gaming these days (especially on EA servers),
disconnects can happen. 

If a disconnect occurs at any point in the game, the winning
team may elect to replay the game in its entirety. Otherwise, the following
parameters should be followed unless instructed otherwise by the league staff::

In the first quarter, the game should be restarted. 

In 2nd - 4th Quarter,Game should be restarted with the same point spread. 

​If a team is up by 21 or more with 4 minutes or less
remaining in the 4th,The league
commissioner sim win the game for the winning team. 

Disconnects are determined at what the score was at the time
of disconnect. If you were "about to score", that is not a valid excuse for
points. 

Any issues, contact a commissioner​ to resolve the
situation! 

**LAGGY GAMES**

If you are experiencing lag, work it out with your opponent
early in the game, not when your losing by 14+ points 

If it takes you till your losing to realize that your game
